# Circular88-KPI
Power Platform solution to manage, gather, report and track performance indicators (KPI). Designed for South African municipalities, based on Circular 88.

## Background
This is provided as a solution accelerator. It's a sample solution which is not supported by Microsoft or myself. Use as a starter to help you get going quickly with a solution for performance indicator management. It is based on Circular 88 requirements and Excel template. It is flexible so that it can be used for scenarios which dont align directly to Circular 88. This solution uses the Dataverse for storage, and has both a Model Driven application (for indicator defintion, settings, rules and more) and a Canvas application (for users to submit their data elements). 

## Features
Here is a list of core features of the solution

- 2
- 3

## How it works
There are 2 main applications which makeup this solution. 1 - Admin Model Driven App (Indicator Manager) 2 - User Indicator Canvas App. All data resides in the Microsoft Dataverse.

More information on how the solution works, including demo is in the attached Solution Demo PPT. Installation instructions in the instructions PPT.

## Provided "As-Is"
This is a a starter / sample. It hasn't been well tested, and is missing some key features that I hope to add over time. It not officialy supported by myself or Microsoft. However, because the unmanaged and managed solution is provided, you should be able to support it yourself, either directly or through a certified Microsoft partner.
